So I paste inline SVG. All elements are wrapped in #all-elements id. Plus each element has it's own group with id, ex: 5_element, 9_element...etc. So when you click on any element on svg, it says the url is an empty value(NULL). So I don't exactly know how to target specific id with data from the database to each element id in svg. My idea was to use if...else condition to check if the dataset ID is equal to the group id for the element then fetch the data for that specific element. I don't know...
